>**Note**: The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

This is our variable

We have 68 variables. For minimize the description we have used the letter `u` (unit: t "time" or f "frequency", the word measure (mean() or std()) and the word direction (X, Y or Z).
There's variable with all combinatiosn

u for unit: frecuency or time (f or t)
measure is mean and std: mean and standar desviation
direction is X, Y and Z: it refere to the directions.

For example u-BodyAcc-measure-direction are 6 variable

tBodyAcc-mean()-X
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
tBodyAcc-std()-X
tBodyAcc-std()-Y
tBodyAcc-std()-Z
fBodyAcc-mean()-X
fBodyAcc-mean()-Y
fBodyAcc-mean()-Z
fBodyAcc-std()-X
fBodyAcc-std()-Y
fBodyAcc-std()-Z

For example u-BodyAccMag-measure  are 4 variable (2 for unit and 2 for measure 2*2=4)
